    // About unit tests, or lack of them...
    // In my solution, the biggest function that I thought would need testing is the
    // data-fetching function. However, the way I've built it doesn't make testing easy,
    // at least with my limited experience with Swift. To make it more testable, I would
    // need to refactor it differently. However, given the time left, I've decided not to
    // do that for now.
